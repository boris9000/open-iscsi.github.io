  "body": "### Introduction\r\nThe Open-iSCSI project provides a high-performance, transport independent,\r\nimplementation of [RFC 3720 iSCSI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7143) for Linux.\r\n\r\nOpen-iSCSI is partitioned into user and kernel parts.\r\n\r\nThe kernel portion of Open-iSCSI is maintained as part of the Linux kernel\r\nand is licensed under the GPL version 2. The kernel part implements iSCSI data path\r\n(that is, iSCSI Read and iSCSI Write), and consists of several\r\nloadable kernel modules and drivers.\r\n\r\nThe Open-ISCSI user space is maintained on the projects [GitHub account](https://github.com/open-iscsi/)\r\n\r\nUser space contains the entire control plane: configuration\r\nmanager, iSCSI Discovery, Login and Logout processing,\r\nconnection-level error processing, Nop-In and Nop-Out handling,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe Open-iSCSI user space consists of a daemon process called\r\niscsid, and a management utility iscsiadm.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nOur mailing list is hosted on Google Groups.\r\n\r\nYou can browse the [archives] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-iscsi)\r\nor [subscribe] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-iscsi/join) through the web interface.\r\n\r\nView and download the [source](https://github.com/open-iscsi/open-iscsi) for the user space tools on GitHub.\r\n\r\nDownload [releases](https://github.com/open-iscsi/open-iscsi/releases) from GitHub as well.\r\n",
